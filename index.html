      Pluck the strings in order, thumb, index, ring, middle, and all over again. After the prelude, the rhythm follows, with a pick in hand, strum without restraints, just play out whatever tunes pop up in my mind. Guitar is my friend and it's always the best remedy. My hands are on it, my fingers shift naturally on different frets. In that very moment, listening to the harmony of six strings and humming the tunes in my mind.The happiness and music helps me regain my strength and reset myself back in order and carry on plucking thumb, index, ring, middle.
